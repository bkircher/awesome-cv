> synchronizing with upstream it focuses on smoothing some day-to-day layout
> pain points:
> - Header contact blocks wrap cleanly across lines with consistent separators
>   and optional photo columns collapse when unused.
> - `\cventry` entries keep summaries and bullet lists separate, fixing the
>   spacing collisions from the original template.
> - Skills and quick-reference sections now have tabular helpers (`cvskill`,
>   `cvtechitems`, `cvdoubleitems`, `cvquickitems`) for better alignment.

## What is Awesome CV?

**Awesome CV** is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or
**Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy
CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to
customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean,
semantic markup.

## How to Use

#### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

If you don't want to install the dependencies on your system, this can also be obtained via [Docker](https://docker.com).

#### Usage

At a command prompt, run

```bash
xelatex {your-cv}.tex
```

Or using docker:

```bash
docker run --rm --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -i -w "/doc" -v "$PWD":/doc texlive/texlive:latest make
```

In either case, this should result in the creation of ``{your-cv}.pdf``
